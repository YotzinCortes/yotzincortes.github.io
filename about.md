Well, hello there. Yotzín here. Thank you for visiting.

This is my personal website. I'm a certified Scrum Product Owner. Currently
living in Mexico, but I love traveling the world. Although I don't consider myself
a full-fledged developer, I do have some coding skills. These skills have developed
particularly after having recently participated in the [Dev.f](http://www.devf.mx/ target="_blank") coding bootcamp in Mexico City.

Before being in web dev, I was a language instructor for six years. Recently I have started an online community of people interested in developing their communicative skills as non-native speakers of English. I did that for a couple a years in a previous job, so I thought that was something I could offer to the local scene of web dev communities. Although we are mostly online, we have face-to-face sessions from time to time. You can register to receive news about upcoming sessions in our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/EnglishBecauseYOLO/ :target="_blank"). We also maintain a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/englishbecauseyolo/ target="_blank") with news about the community.

In this site I will write about web dev and the development of communicative
skills for non-native speakers of English. As well as some other related professional topics.
Eventually I will also write about more personal stuff. Je parle un petit français. Se habla español.
