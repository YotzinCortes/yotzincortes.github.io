Hi, my name is Yotzín. I'm a certified Scrum Product Owner. I am currently
living in Mexico, but I love traveling the world. Although I don't consider myself
a full-fledged developer, I do have some coding skills. These skills have developed
particularly after having recently participated in the Dev.f coding bootcamp in Mexico
City.

In this site I will write about web dev and the development of communicative
skills for non-native speakers of English and some other related professional topics.
Eventually I will also write about more personal stuff. Before being in web dev,
I was a language instructor for six years. And I have always been a technology enthusiast. Je parle un
petit francais. Se habla español.

If you are looking for my professional profile, you can learn more about me at my
[LinkedIn page](http://jekyllrb.com/). You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Yotzin).

Thank you for passing by.

Y.
