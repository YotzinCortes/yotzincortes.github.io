  Imagine that you want to buy a video streaming player. It’s early in the day, before going out for work, and you use your laptop to do a bit of research online. You find that the most popular options today are the Apple TV, Roku and Chromecast players. You go through the technical specs for each device and then close down your laptop to have breakfast.

  During lunchtime, you use the desktop computer at work to browse over reviews for the different players, and even save a couple of links. Later in the day, you use your iPad to compare prices at Pricegrabber and find the best offer at Amazon. You decide to consider all of the information you have acquired so far and ponder it before making the final decision.

  After work, you use your Android-powered smartphone to ask around your friends and connections on Facebook and Twitter about their experiences and opinions about the devices in question. Very quickly, you get plenty of responses. You focus on the most useful ones and move on with your purchase. A minute later, you head straight to Amazon and buy the Chromecast, because it matches your needs and budget, and also because of the positive comments expressed by your friends on the social networks.

  If that buying experience rang any bells for you, then you are, like me, what digital commerce experts are now calling a Connected Consumer. This type of consumer is typically well informed about the item or service he is looking for, and expects the retailer to know more and offer support to complete the transaction.

  So, in a nutshell, and looking back at the story we described above, Omnichannel eCommerce refers to the purchase experience integration offered by vendors and stores across OS platforms like Android and iOS, and devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets. Imagine that your eCommerce business could offer a unified experience to your customers all the way from the moment they started thinking about buying until checking out your product or service, using the trail of information left behind by their browsing course. That&#39;s omnichannel, and why do you need it? Well, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/omni-channel-retailers-connected-consumers">the future of eCommerce is going that way</a></p>

  To describe this in a more graphical way, here’s an infographic from David Sealey of Smart Insights:

  As you can see, omnichannel experiences are all about the improvement of the customer experience with the intention of making a brand advocate who will bring more customers to your store. Let’s not forget <a href="http://www.paypromedia.com/2013/07/19/there-is-no-i-in-customer-the-importance-of-word-of-mouth-marketing/">the power of word of mouth advertising</a>

  Here are some ways to integrate omnichannel experiences in your store:

  <ul>
  <li>Integrating customer reviews</li>
  <li>Adding social media capabilities</li>
  <li>Remembering the buying preferences of your customers</li>
  </ul>

  I'll discuss more about this topic in this other post.
