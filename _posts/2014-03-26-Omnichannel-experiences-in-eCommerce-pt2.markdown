Drawing from the ideas on this older <a href="http://yotzincortes.com/ecommerce/2015/07/28/Omnichannel-experiences-in-eCommerce-pt1.1.html">post</a> and a webinar on omnichannel from <a href="http://www.userzoom.com">UserZoom</a> I have recently attended, I’d like to share a bit more of information about omnichannel experiences. More specifically: how to create them and how crucial they are to increase and expand your customer base and sales.

<h2>First things first: the difference between single, multi, cross and omnichannel experiences.</h2>

Let’s begin by defining the predecessors of the omnichannel eCommerce:

<em>Single channel</em>: in this type of contact with the client, there’s only one way to offer your product or service to your customers, e.g: you have your store in a  website, but there’s no mobile version or native application for iOS or Android.

<em>Multi channel</em>: this type of contact considers more than one line of servicing the customer, but each channel has an independent user experience, e.g: an ecommerce that has a website and a tablet app, but without the possibility of combining the navigation data of each channel to offer a more personalized experience to the customer.

<em>Cross channel</em>: this form of customer contact allows for several channels and the transfer of the customer data across them.

<em>Omnichannel</em>: considers all touch points and channels as a single entity, constantly connected.

<h2>Omnichannel shoppers, who are they?</h2>

<p>Now, research has been done about the identity of those shoppers who expect omnichannel experiences. Here are some typical characteristics, do they sound familiar to you?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They spend more than multichannel and single channel shoppers. </p></li>
<li><p>They influence others. They become your brand ambassadors via their social network interactions and other types of online activity.</p></li>
<li><p>They exhibit strong loyalty to your brand, which leads to free word-of-mouth publicity for your business :)</p></li>
<li><p>They are very demanding and expect an immersive and intuitive experience on all channels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are three subtypes of omnichannel shoppers, which are: </p>

<p><strong>Integrated</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is economically stable</li>
<li>Is 30 to 50 years old</li>
<li>Is well connected at home and at the office. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Young mobile</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is younger than 30</li>
<li>Is always on the move</li>
<li>Texts a lot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Social Networker</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is usually young</li>
<li>Is driven by very specific interests</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking into consideration those characteristics we will be able to tend to the needs of our omnichannel shoppers. </p>

<h2>How to build omnichannel experiences:</h2>

<p>All of the departments involved in the creation and maintenance of your store should work very closely. Marketing, IT and sales have to work in synchrony towards the same goal of offering a seamless experience for your customers. </p>

<p>So now, how do you actually achieve omnichannel? Here are some <strong>suggestions</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Model transitions and predict changes in the user experience</li>
<li>Foresee switching of channels and track them, what are they telling you?</li>
<li>Do it early: build maps of your store and the experience at every section. </li>
<li>Do it often: revise and perfect your experience design. </li>
<li>Consider all touch points: physical, digital and human, they have to be in sync, offering the same experience. </li>
<li>Follow and observe your customer behaviour. </li>
<li>Know your customer, look for workarounds, what do they need to adjust to? identify it and make an improvement to their experience, innovate!</li>
<li>Integrate: Service Design  + UX + CX</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s in it for you business?</h2>

<p>You have a lot to gain if you offer omnichannel experiences for your customers in your store.
