  <article class="post-content">
    <p>{This post was originally posted <a href="http://blog.crowdint.com/2014/01/28/how-to-improve-your-english-skills.html" target="_blank">here</a>}</p>

<p>If you are not a native speaker of English and are looking for ways to improve your language skills, I’d like to share some ideas with you. This post was written from my experience as an English learner and teacher. During the time I have been fulfilling the position of English advisor at <a href="https://www.crowdint.com/" target="_blank">Crowd Interactive</a>, I have learned to identify some of the most useful ways to improve the language skills of someone who works in software development. But this post was also influenced by the feedback I received from many of my coworkers when I asked the question: “what are some strategies that have helped you improve your English?” (and I thank them for their input).</p>

<p>You surely know by now the reasons why you should take your English skills to the highest possible level; your command of the language will have a direct impact in your success in the web-development world. It doesn’t matter what role you would like to have now or in the future, developer, project manager or CTO, the importance of your English level will just continue getting more and more relevant as you climb up the ladder of the company ranks.</p>

<p>Some companies have hired English experts to help them create and run English programs. If you work for one of those companies, take advantage of the help of that person as much as you can, but never forget that the one who is ultimately responsible for your own learning is no one but yourself. So, roll up your sleeves and get down to work!</p>

<h3>Look for materials from reputable sources.</h3>

<p>There are literally millions of resources to learn languages, and English in particular, in the web. That’s why it may be a bit tricky to choose the ones you can really trust. Cambridge and Oxford have been in the business of teaching English as a foreign language for a very long time, and they have the reputation of being two of the best universities in the world for a reason. Both Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press have dedicated websites to showcase their digital materials, check them out here: <a href="http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/" target="_blank">CUP</a> and <a href="https://elt.oup.com/?cc=mx&amp;selLanguage=enuniversities">OUP</a>. A notable example of an app from Cambridge is <a href="http://www.englishmonstruo.org/" target="_blank">English Monstruo</a>. If your first language is Spanish this is a great tool to polish your English. The app is made up of a series of highly addictive mini-games that make use of the most common mistakes made by Spanish speakers in the EFL examinations conducted by Cambridge every year. There’s a version for both Android and iOS, so check it out in each corresponding software store.</p>

<h3>Use Duolingo</h3>

<p>There are plenty of apps to learn English out there, but <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> is by far the best. The key to its success is gamification. Duolingo looks like a videogame, and hooks you like a videogame. It’s completely free, and there are lessons for every level of proficiency in several languages (English included). After you are done with the lessons (or earlier, if you ever feel like skipping them) you move on to the translation exercises. There you translate real websites, and can see discussions about the meaning of phrases or expressions initiated by other Duolingo users. It even has a function to improve your pronunciation by talking to the app, which isn’t perfect (I’ve noticed that sometimes it doesn’t recognize a well-pronounced phrase) but it can still be useful. The only thing that Duolingo can’t really do for you is develop your speaking skills, but other than that, it’s a great tool.</p>

<h3>Read as if your life depended on it.</h3>

<p>Reading helps you become aware of the conventions of the English language. Read as much as you can, technical and non-technical stuff, and make a habit of sharing what you read with others, as that will help to increase your retention rate. Make sure that the resources you use to find answers when you get stuck trying to fix a bug or writing a feature are in English. Sometimes we tend to find answers in our native language, but that won’t help you at all. Use every piece of vocabulary you just learned in an appropriate context of your life to imprint it on your brain, and discuss it with other people to confirm its meaning.</p>

<h3>Music is your best friend.</h3>

<p>Find the lyrics of the artists you like and translate them into your native language. Don’t stop at the literal meaning and try and get the metaphorical meaning. Watch TV shows with English subtitles on and then without subtitles. Listen to audiobooks too.</p>

<h3>Develop the craft of writing.</h3>

<p>A great way of sharing what you read is by writing about it. Start a personal blog where you share your views about any topic that interests you. Don’t worry about having a big audience at first, the point is to process the ideas in your mind for your own benefit. Share your thoughts in writing and share your entries with friends and colleagues and start discussions. Alternatively, you can make the commitment of contributing with a collective blog, that can help with the discipline of writing regularly. Don’t fall into the habit of overgeneralizing about everything, make the effort of finding the right word for the idea you want to express as it will increase your vocabulary substantially.</p>

<h3>Oral expression is king.</h3>

<p>In the end, your ultimate goal is to SPEAK in English with your clients and colleagues, right? So, talk, talk, and then talk some more. Your speaking skills, like any other skills, can only be developed if they are put into practice. Talk as much as possible with as many people as possible, native or non-native speakers of English. Do in English the things you would normally do in Spanish. Speaking is a complex ability that gets better over time, and requires as much exposure to the language as you can get. Don’t worry about being corrected. Embrace any corrections coming your way, and be thankful for people’s feedback about your language skills. Remember that even native speakers make pronunciation mistakes from time to time. Set off to improve your skills following these guidelines and I assure you will notice results quicker than you think.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful. Please let me know of any other strategies you put into practice to improve your English in the comments section, or hit me up on Twitter. Peace out!</p>

<p>Y.</p>
